## Database Schema
The system uses the following tables:

### 1. **Admin Table**
Stores admin user details.
CREATE TABLE Admin (
    Admin_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Admin_name VARCHAR(255),
    Password VARCHAR(255)
);

### 2. **Product Table**
Stores product details.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Product (
    P_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    P_Name VARCHAR(255),
    Price INT,
    Category VARCHAR(255),
    Quantity INT,
    Admin_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Admin_id) REFERENCES Admin(Admin_id)
);
```

### 3. **Notifications Table**
Stores products with low stock (below 10).
```sql
CREATE TABLE Notifications (
    P_Name VARCHAR(255),
    Quantity INT
);
```

### 4. **Customer Table**
Stores customer details.
```sql
CREATE TABLE Customer (
    C_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    C_Name VARCHAR(255),
    Email VARCHAR(255),
    Phone VARCHAR(20),
    Password VARCHAR(255),
    Address VARCHAR(255)
);
```

### 5. **Transaction Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE Transaction (
    T_Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    C_Id INT,
    P_Id INT,
    Quantity INT,
    Total_Price INT,
    Transaction_Date DATETIME,
    FOREIGN KEY (C_Id) REFERENCES Customer(C_Id),
    FOREIGN KEY (P_Id) REFERENCES Product(P_Id)
);
```


### 6. **Order Table**

    C_Id INT,
    Order_Date DATETIME,
    Total_Price INT,
    Status VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (C_Id) REFERENCES Customer(C_Id)
);
```

## Admin Functionalities
### 1. **CRUD Operations on Products**:
   - **Create Product**: Admins can add new products to the system, providing details like product name, price, category, and quantity.
   
   ```java
   String query = "INSERT INTO Product (P_Name, Price, Category, Quantity, Admin_id) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)";
   ```
   
   - **Read Product**: Admins can view all product information in a table format.
   
   ```java
   String query = "SELECT * FROM Product";
   PreparedStatement ps = conn.prepareStatement(query);
   ResultSet rs = ps.executeQuery();
   ```
   
   - **Update Product**: Admins can modify product details (price, quantity, etc.).
   
   ```java
   String query = "UPDATE Product SET Price = ?, Quantity = ? WHERE P_Id = ?";
   ```
   
   - **Delete Product**: Admins can delete a product from the inventory.
   
   ```java
   String query = "DELETE FROM Product WHERE P_Id = ?";
   ```

### 2. **Product Analytics**:
Admins can view product-related statistics:
   - **Total number of products**
   - **Maximum price of products**
   - **Minimum price of products**

   Example query for total product count and price analytics:
   
   ```java
   String query = "SELECT COUNT(*) AS totalProducts, AVG(Price) AS avgPrice, MAX(Price) AS maxPrice, MIN(Price) AS minPrice FROM Product";
   ```

### 3. **Notifications for Low Stock**:
Admins can view notifications for products with a quantity less than 10.
   
   ```java
   String query = "SELECT P_Name, Quantity FROM Product WHERE Quantity < 10";
   ```

### 4. **Transaction Management**:
Admins can generate receipts for customer purchases by recording the product, quantity, total price, and transaction date.

   ```java
   String query = "INSERT INTO Transaction (C_Id, P_Id, Quantity, Total_Price, Transaction_Date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, NOW())";
   ```

## Customer Functionalities

Customers can view the list of available products with information like:
   - Product name
   - Price
   - Category
   
### 2. **Generate Receipts**:
Customers can generate a receipt for their purchase, which includes:
